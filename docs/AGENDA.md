# Agenda #

## Date: 4/7/2019 ##

- [x] Confirm our follow-up meeting times for the future (notably, Tuesdays). (est. ~5 minutes) - Tuesday @ 3:30PM - 5:00PM.

- [x] Validate our local installations of Sugar (and troubleshoot any issues). (est. ~30 minutes)

- [x] Create our design documents for the game. (This means thinking about state machines, game-flow, and sequence of events). (est. ~60 minutes)

- [x] Collect open-source/public domain/free(libre) artwork for the game.

- [x] Design a theme that the game should be focused on. (Of course, we will graybox things, but, theme can help guide choices).

- [x] Make final decision on the mini-games that we want. Potentially use the proof-of concept to test out and see how easy each one is to make.

- [x] Assign mini-games / gameflow / other tasks to each person. Some may be in Unity. Others may be in Python. - Assigned to @jks7743 and @rimij405.
