## Theme ##

Baggage Claim is an airport-themed activity in which learners must identify mathematical concepts such as fractions and compare values for inequality. There are two main modes in the game: comparison of fractions to get suitcases 'beneath' a certain weight threshold and matching suitcases with one other by its size.

## Mechanics ##

Each mode has its list of featuers. Strech goals are *emphasized*.

### Mode 1 - Weight A Minute ###

Learners must weigh suitcases of various 'weights' to learn about fractional comparisons.

Target: Fractions. Geometry.

Featureset:

- Comparison of fractions.
- Comparison of large whole numbers.
- Comparison of shapes (and their number of sides).
- *Customizable suitcases. (Progression system).*

### Mode 2 - Finder's Keepers ###

Learners must compare an image of their suitcase and find the matching size from a collection of them.

Target: Geometry.

Featureset:

- Comparison of objects to find 'like' objects.
- *Customizable suitecases. (Progression system).*
- *Additional metrics to compare suitcase against.*

### Mode 3 - Pack It In (stretch goal) ###

Players are given a maximum weight and several suitcases, and they have to
load as many suitcases as they can without going over the target weight.
Weights are given as fractions, so players' ability to add and compare
fractions of different bases is tested.

Target: Fractions

Featureset:

- Comparison of fractions.
- Addition of fractions.
- *Customizable suitcases (Progression system)*

## Aesthetic ##

The game should be in line with the presentation of other Sugar Activities.

### Art / User Interface ###

The sugar platform uses an incredibly simple design scheme. We should design our games with those elements in mind.
